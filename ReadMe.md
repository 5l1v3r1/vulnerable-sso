**Vulnerable SSO Project**

Vulnerable SSo is focused on single sign on related vulnerabilities.
If you want to learn, you should check this and contribute this project.

VulnSSO tool is focused on sso attacks. Nowadays most of the company uses their own implementation for sso solutions. Some of the bug hunters found really good vulnerability on the big company.
There are some tools(dvwa and others .. ) that contains vulnerability. They don't have any support for sso vulnerability. 

Our focus is only sso related bugs. VulnSSO is training tool.It will contain redirect uri vulnerability , XXE on saml request  and many others.

Vuln SSO project has three app.
- Client App 
- Authentication Server
- Resource Server

**Client App**

This application is used for starting point. It redirects user to authentication server.If end user enters right credentials authentication server redirect user to client app again.

**Authentication Server**

Authentication app is main point of this project.It has login page. This page contains user and password field. Redirected user enters credentials and authentication server checks it.
Spring security has static inmemory feature. This feature accept hardcoded username and password. For this reason there is no database integration in this project.

**Resource Server**

This part main page of application for authenticated users. After authentication process, user will redirect this page.
